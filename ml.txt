Machine Learning Notes

1. Definition:
Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables systems to learn patterns from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.

2. Types of Machine Learning:
- Supervised Learning: Uses labeled data (e.g., classification, regression).
- Unsupervised Learning: Uses unlabeled data to find hidden patterns (e.g., clustering, dimensionality reduction).
- Reinforcement Learning: Learns by interacting with an environment, receiving rewards or penalties.

3. Key Algorithms:
- Linear Regression, Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees, Random Forests
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Naive Bayes
- Neural Networks, Deep Learning
- K-Means Clustering, DBSCAN, PCA

4. Applications:
- Image Recognition (Computer Vision)
- Natural Language Processing (Chatbots, Sentiment Analysis)
- Recommendation Systems (Netflix, Amazon)
- Fraud Detection
- Predictive Analytics in Healthcare and Finance

5. Important Concepts:
- Overfitting vs Underfitting
- Training, Validation, Test datasets
- Feature Engineering
- Gradient Descent
- Hyperparameter Tuning
- Bias-Variance Tradeoff

6. Tools & Libraries:
- Python (Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch)
- Data handling: Pandas, NumPy
- Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

7. Workflow:
1. Data Collection
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Model Selection
4. Training the Model
5. Evaluation
6. Deployment
